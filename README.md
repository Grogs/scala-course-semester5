# Lesson 3

Over the course will be build a hotel listing website.

Today, you will implement some required Scala services on the backend.

Tasks
* Checkout the `lesson3`branch
  ```
  git stash
  git pull
  git checkout lesson3
  ```
* Run `./sbt test` and you should see 3 test suites failing
* Fix the failings tests. The test failures include clues.
  * Start with the `GeographyServiceTest`, you'll need to implement the methods in `GeoographyService`.
  * Then move onto the `HotelFinderServiceTest`, you'll need to implement the methods in `HotelFinderService`.
  * And finally fix the tests in `HotelServiceTest`, you'll need to implement the methods in `HotelService`.
* Let us know once you've done this, or grab Adam or myself for help!
