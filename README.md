# Lesson 8

Start by checking out the `lesson8`branch

For this lesson, we want to allow the user to display the search results on a map.
  
Steps:

1. Add a button to open a bootstrap modal, where we'll display the map. 
    * Documentation: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/javascript/#modals
    * Fix the failing test in `services.hotels.Lesson8`.  

2. Add an empty Map inside the modal.
    * Put the map related code in the `onMapOpen' function in `App` which runs every time the user opens the Map.
    * See https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/map-simple
    * NOTE: In the docs a JavaScript object literal is used when creating the `Map`, and the center's latitude and logitude.
      But we don't pass object literals from ScalaJS if we can avoid it. We want type safety! 
      So, instead, you will have to pass a instance of `MapOptions` to `Map` and create a `LatLng` for the center.

3. Add a Marker for each Hotel. 
    * See https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/marker-simple
    * You'll have to call the backend for the hotels again, in the same way we did last week using the Autowire Client.
    * NOTE: Again, like the Map, we won't use an object literal to configure the marker, use `MarkerOptions` instead.

4. Update the Map's LatLngBounds, so the Map focuses on the right area. 
    * See https://coderwall.com/p/hojgtq/auto-center-and-auto-zoom-a-google-map

5. Add InfoWindows to display a Hotel's description when a marker is clicked on. 
    * See https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/infowindow-simple
